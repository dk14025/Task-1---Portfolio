                <h2>Project 1: Typing Speed Test Website</h2>
                <p>The project “Typing Speed Test” is a website that measures an individual's typing speed and accuracy. 
                    The test-taker is presented with a passage and is given one minute to type as much of the passage as possible. The test generates three scores: Words per Minute (WPM), Number of Errors, Characters per Minute (CPM). 
                    Typing test evaluation is done by matching the given passage with the passage typed by the user to find out errors. The final WPM score is calculated using a formula. This project aims to increase productivity of student and saving time in long run, increase mind muscle coordination and make the coding experience a little less frustrating.</p>

                <h2>Project 2: Face Recognition Attendance System</h2>
                <p>This project aims to automate the process of attendance management in educational institutions like schools, colleges. It reduces the time and effort required for attendance marking and maintains an electronic record of attendance. This project intends to minimize the chances of proxy attendance by using face recognition, which should theoretically ensure that only registered students can mark their attendance. Face detection uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier for real-time face detection. Face recognition enhances security by matching detected faces with registered individuals. Database stores the attendance records securely. User interface provides an intuitive interface for system control and attendance reporting.</p>

                <h2>Project 3: Bank Customer Churn Prediction</h2>
                <p>This project delves into the realm of customer churn analysis within the banking sector, 
                    aiming to uncover the intricacies of why customers depart, how banks can predict churn, and 
                    strategies for retention. By meticulously analyzing factors such as service quality, product 
                    offerings, economic fluctuations, and competitor actions, the project provides a 
                    comprehensive understanding of churn drivers. Leveraging sophisticated methodologies 
                    including predictive modeling and sentiment analysis, it equips banks with the tools to 
                    forecast churn and implement preemptive measures. Moreover, the project explores 
                    innovative retention strategies such as personalized offerings and proactive customer service, 
                    paving the way for enhanced customer loyalty and sustained profitability in the competitive 
                    banking landscape.</p>
